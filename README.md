# Responsive Blog Cards Project

This project is a simple responsive blog layout built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
It demonstrates how to create modern blog post cards with images, titles, descriptions, and post metadata (time to read, views, and comments).  

The design is inspired by common blog layouts and is optimized for both **desktop** and **mobile** devices.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Three responsive blog post cards arranged side by side on desktop and stacked on mobile.
- Each card includes:
  - Featured image at the top.
  - Published date label (e.g., "4 days ago", "1 week ago").
  - Post title and description.
  - Footer with **reading time**, **views**, and **comments**.
- Different footer colors per card (pink, orange, green).
- Rounded corners, box shadows, and hover effects for a clean, modern design.
- Semantic HTML tags (`header`, `section`, `article`) for better structure.
- Fully responsive design using CSS Flexbox.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Provides the semantic structure of the blog (header, section, article, etc.).
- **CSS3** – Used for styling the blog cards, layout, responsiveness, and hover effects.
  - **Flexbox** for responsive layout.
  - **Media Queries** for mobile optimization.
- **Placeholder Images** – Images are pulled from [https://picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos) for demo purposes.

👉 Do you want me to also add a **“Getting Started GIF/Screenshot”** in the README (like showing how the cards stack on mobile vs desktop), or just keep it text-based for now?
